# Tour-de-France
 This project is about tour de France, the most prestigious cycling race in the world. It is a really big cycling race that attracts viewers from many part of the world.
I am here as a data visualization expert to educate new viewers, highlight the magnitude of the event and build anticipation for this year's race.
My goal is to ask the data why this race happens to be the most prestigious cycling race in the world. Lets dig in.Tour de France happens to be the most prestigious because it has the most challenging terrainWe have the flat, mountain, time trial, team time trial stages.
This stages require endurance, speed, tactics and cooperation among team members.It has the greatest champions, the likes of Bernard Hinault, Chris Froome...
It has one of the best record breaking performances by riders, we have the likes of Tadej Podagcar, Jona Vinegegaard...
